## Guess the Color

This color guessing game is based on the RGB color model written in vanilla JavaScript.

The rules are simple, 
- Choose the right color based on provided `RGB(red, green, blue)` and win the game. 
- If you do not feel confident, switch to `easy` mode.
- If the game is too easy, choose the `hard` level.

Its a color guessing game based on the fact that every color is a combination of three primary color red,green and blue. I have used JavaScript(vanilla JS),Html and CSS for this project. This game aims to develop the color predicting ability of a person as the game generates random color each time and also adds curiosity to an individual to find the possible color formed due to random combination of primary color..

The rules are simple, 
- Choose the right color based on provided `RGB(red, green, blue)` and win the game. 
- If you do not feel confident, switch to `easy` mode.
- If the game is too easy, choose the `hard` level.
